# Physics after lecture task â„–3

## Simulation of the magnetic field created by currents.

Variant I

Input parameters: magnitude and location of currents in two-dimensional
space.
Final view of the model: Executable model, integrated into an html document,
which shows the appearance (lines) of the magnetic field in two-dimensional space,
created by several currents
